# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity & UX Design
*   **iOS Aesthetics with Playful Colors:** The application should mimic the look and feel of a native iOS application, utilizing rounded corners, SF Symbols (or similar clean icon sets), and standard spacing. This is balanced by a vibrant, colorful, and playful design language.
*   **Dynamic Course Theming:** Each course is assigned a unique, vibrant color and a custom emoji. This theme should consistently apply to the course card, learning path nodes, and relevant UI accents.
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Incorporate subtle iOS-style animations, bounces, and visual "pops" when users interact with gamification elements (XP, Coins, Streaks) to provide immediate, satisfying feedback.
*   **Soft Geometry:** Use generous border-radius (e.g., `12px` to `24px`) for cards and containers to maintain a soft, friendly, and modern iOS-like appearance.

## Gamification & Progress Visualization
*   **The Path of Success:** The learning path line should visibly fill with a solid green color as levels are completed.
*   **Achievement Glow:** Completed nodes and the associated green path should emit a subtle green glow to emphasize progress and accomplishments.
*   **Functional Streaks:** The streak mechanic must be reliable and prominently (but compactly) displayed as a core motivational element.

## Tone & Messaging
*   **Encouraging & Motivational:** The app's copy should be positive, supportive, and celebratory. Use playful language and frequent feedback to keep learners engaged and motivated throughout their journey.
